1️⃣ Static Website on S3 + CloudFront + (optional) Route 53
A simple personal website (HTML/CSS only) hosted on S3, accelerated with CloudFront, and optionally reachable via a custom domain.
Your README has: short explanation of what S3, CloudFront, and Route 53 are and a diagram of how a user request flows.

What’s expected:
- You host your site on S3 static website hosting (index.html + error.html).
- You set correct bucket policy so the site can be accessed publicly, but only the website, not random uploads.
- You add CloudFront in front of S3 to cache content and make it faster.
- (Bonus) You connect a custom domain using Route 53 and configure HTTPS with ACM.


2️⃣ Two-Tier Web App in a VPC (EC2 + RDS)
A basic web app where the frontend runs on EC2 in public subnets, and the database (RDS) is in private subnets. Classic “web + DB” architecture.
README explains, in simple terms, why we separate public vs private and how traffic flows.

What’s expected:
- You create a VPC with:
  - 2 public subnets in different AZs (for web servers)
  - 2 private subnets in different AZs (for DB)
- Web server EC2s live in public subnets with a load balancer (ALB) in front.
- The DB (RDS) is in private subnets with no public access; only web servers can talk to it.
- You correctly set security groups:
- ALB accepts HTTP/HTTPS from internet
- EC2 accepts traffic only from ALB
- RDS accepts traffic only from EC2 SG


3️⃣ “Production-Style” VPC Networking (NAT, IGW, Route Tables)

What you build: A clean VPC network layout that looks like something a real company would use: public/private subnets, NAT gateway, internet gateway, proper routes.
README contains diagrams and screenshots showing: Route tables, Ping tests from public vs private instances, Explanation of “why we don’t put everything in public subnet.”

What’s expected:
- One VPC with:
  - 2 public subnets (for internet-facing stuff)
  - 2 private subnets (for internal servers)
- Internet Gateway attached for public traffic.
- NAT Gateway in a public subnet so private instances can reach the internet (for updates) without being exposed.
- Different route tables:
  - Public subnets → route 0.0.0.0/0 to IGW
  - Private subnets → route 0.0.0.0/0 to NAT
- You spin up:
  - 1 EC2 in public subnet (can SSH/HTTP from internet)
  - 1 EC2 in private subnet (no direct internet, but can ping/curl external sites via NAT)


4️⃣ Serverless API (API Gateway + Lambda + DynamoDB)
What you build: A tiny backend API—for example, a “Todo list” or “Notes” service—without servers, just functions and a database.
README explains: What “serverless” means, High-level flow: user → API GW → Lambda → DDB → response, Simple example of a JSON request/response.

What’s expected:
- You design a simple REST API with endpoints like:
- POST /items (create)
- GET /items (list)
- API Gateway routes requests to Lambda functions.
- Lambda functions are written in Python or Node.js and talk to a DynamoDB table.
- You use IAM roles so Lambda has permissions to DynamoDB (no hard-coded keys).


5️⃣ CI/CD Pipeline (CodePipeline / GitHub → EC2 or S3)
What you build:Automatic deployment pipeline so when you push code, AWS deploys it for you—no manual uploads.
README includes: Screenshot(s) of pipeline stages, Explanation of what happens from “git push” to “app updated”, One small note on where logs live when something fails.

What’s expected:
- Source: GitHub repo or CodeCommit repo with your app (even just a simple HTML or Node app).
- CodeBuild step that runs tests/build (even simple ones like npm test or pytest).
- Deploy step:
  - Either deploys a static site to S3, or
  - Updates an app running on EC2 (e.g., via CodeDeploy or user data scripts).
- You break it at least once, then fix it, and document it.


6️⃣ Logging & Monitoring: CloudWatch + Alarms + Dashboards

What you build:
Monitoring for an app so you can tell if it’s healthy and react when something breaks.

What’s expected:
- Take one of your previous projects (like the 2-tier app) and:
- Enable CloudWatch logs for EC2 (via CloudWatch Agent or default logs)
- Enable detailed monitoring on EC2.
- Create CloudWatch Alarms on:
- High CPU (e.g., > 70% for 5 min)
- Low free disk or high memory (if using agent)
- Configure alarms to send notifications through SNS (email).
- Build a simple CloudWatch Dashboard that shows:
- EC2 CPU and network
- DS CPU or connections if used

README explains:
Why monitoring is important
Example scenario: “If CPU is high for a long time, maybe we need Auto Scaling or better instance.”


7️⃣ Backup & Disaster Recovery Mini-Plan

What you build:
A small system that has backups and a simple disaster-recovery procedure.

What’s expected:
- Use your web+DB project again:
- Enable automated backups for RDS, with defined retention.
- Create manual EBS snapshots for EC2 root volumes.
- For S3, set up:
- Versioning
- Lifecycle rules (e.g., move old versions to Glacier after 30/60 days).
- Document a basic DR scenario, like:
- “App server deleted. Steps to restore: launch new EC2 from AMI, attach security groups, update ALB target group.”
- “DB corrupted. Steps to restore: create new RDS from snapshot, point app to new endpoint.”

README is very human:
“If X happens, here’s what I’d do. Here are screenshots of the settings.”


8️⃣ Hybrid Networking “Lab” – Packet Tracer + AWS Design

What you build:
Not full real VPN (because that needs real devices), but a design + partial implementation of an on-prem network talking to AWS.

What’s expected:
- In Packet Tracer, you design a small “company” network:
- 1 core router, 1 switch, a few PCs/servers in VLANs.
- Use private IP ranges like 10.0.0.0/24, 10.0.1.0/24.
- In AWS, you design a VPC with subnets like 10.1.0.0/16, clearly not overlapping with on-prem.
- You create:
- A VPN Gateway (VGW) or at least plan for one on AWS side.
- A Customer Gateway config describing the on-prem router’s public IP and tunnel settings (this can be theoretical).
- The key here is the architecture + configs:
- Show how routes would look on on-prem router (Packet Tracer)
- Show AWS route tables where traffic for 10.0.0.0/16 goes via the VPN

README + diagrams explain in simple words:
“This is our imaginary office. This is our cloud network. This tunnel connects them so office PCs can talk to cloud servers like they are in the same network.”
This project proves you understand how network + cloud integrate, even without real hardware.


9️⃣ Infrastructure as Code (Terraform or CloudFormation)

What you build:
Take one of your earlier environments (for example, the VPC + EC2 project) and rebuild it entirely from code, not clicking around the console.

What’s expected:
- Choose Terraform (simpler for job market) or CloudFormation.
- Your code should create at least:
- VPC
- Public & private subnets
- Internet Gateway, NAT, route tables
- Security groups
- 1 or 2 EC2 instances
- You can destroy and recreate the whole environment with one command (terraform destroy / apply).

README explains:
Why IaC is powerful (repeatable, version-controlled, team-friendly)
How to run your code (terraform init/apply etc.)
Example of changing one variable (like instance type) and re-applying.


🔟 Multi-Environment Setup + Cost/Permissions Management

What you build:
A simple “company-style” account structure with dev/test/prod separation and basic cost and IAM controls.

What’s expected:
- t minimum, separate environments:
- Either 3 separate AWS accounts (preferred, using AWS Organizations if possible), or
- 1 account with clearly separated dev/test/prod VPCs and naming conventions.
- IAM setup:
- Admin role (for you)
- Read-only role
- “Developer” role that can only touch dev environment.
- Tagging strategy:
- Tags like Environment=Dev/Prod, Owner=Zivana, Project=cloud_path.
- Budgets + Alerts:
- Use AWS Budgets to set a low monthly limit and email when near it.

README includes:
Explanation of why dev/stage/prod separation matters
How tags help with cost reports
Screenshot of a cost/budget alert setup.
